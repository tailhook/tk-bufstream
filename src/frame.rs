/// Decoding of a frame from an internal buffer.

/// This trait is used when constructing an instance of `Framed`. It defines how
/// to decode the incoming bytes on a stream to the specified type of frame for
/// that framed I/O stream.
///
/// The primary method of this trait, `decode`, attempts to decode a
/// frame from a buffer of bytes. It has the option of returning `NotReady`,
/// indicating that more bytes need to be read before decoding can
/// continue.

    /// This method is called by `Framed` whenever bytes are ready to be parsed.
    /// The provided buffer of bytes is what's been read so far, and this
    /// instance of `Decode` can determine whether an entire frame is in the
    /// buffer and is ready to be returned.
    ///
    /// If an entire frame is available, then this instance will remove those
    /// bytes from the buffer provided and return them as a decoded
    /// frame. Note that removing bytes from the provided buffer doesn't always
    /// necessarily copy the bytes, so this should be an efficient operation in
    /// most circumstances.
    ///
    /// If the bytes look valid, but a frame isn't fully available yet, then
    /// `Ok(None)` is returned. This indicates to the `Framed` instance that
    /// it needs to read some more bytes before calling this method again.

    /// returned indicating why. This informs `Framed` that the stream is now
